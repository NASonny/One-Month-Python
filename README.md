## FAQ

#### My feedback on it ? 

If you're interested in everything written above as well as the techno and want to deepen your skills, I can only encourage you especially if you have the GitHub Student Pack! Unfortunately, you won't be entitled to the certificate that One Month gives at the end, so neither will I 😄, but it's clearly worth it! And it can be done in less than a week if you're really into it and its totaly worth it ! 

## Completed 🚀

The five lessons misses is Homework and Certification with Student Pack i couldn't get 😔
